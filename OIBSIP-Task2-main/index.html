          Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam (Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam) was born on
          15th October 1931 in the temple town of Rameswaram, located in Tamil
          Nadu. He was born to a very poor Tamil Muslim family.
        </p>

        <p>
          His father was a boatman, and an imam in a local mosque, and his
          mother was a housewife. Due to poverty, Dr. Abdul Kalam had to sell
          newspapers in his early childhood to run his family, but he was a
          hardworking and sharp student.
        </p>

        <p>
          He started his schooling from Schwartz Higher School in
          Ramanathapuram. He then moved on to complete his graduation in physics
          from the University of Madras and after that to study aerospace
          technology from the Madras Institute of Technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dr. Kalam started his career as a scientist from the Aeronautical
          Development Establishment of DRDO and worked under the eminent
          scientist Vikram Sarabhai.
        </p>

        <p>
          He started his contribution as a scientist in 1969 when he was the
          project director of Indiaâ€™s first satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III)
          was used to launch the satellite Rohini in 1980 and is considered the
          developer of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.
        </p>

        <p>
          He also played a crucial role in the development of Agni and Prithvi
          missiles. Dr. Kalam was the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime
          Minister in 1992 when the Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted. In
          2002, Dr. Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India.
        </p>

        <p>
          He had received the title of "People's President." During his tenure
          as President, he had rejected the mercy plea of the Dhananjoy
          Chatterjee, convicted of brutal rape and murder.
        </p>

        <p>He was only the third President to be awarded the Bharat Ratna.</p>

        <p>
          He also imposed President's rule in Bihar in 2005. However, he did not
          file for Presidency for a second term and instead returned to the
          field of academics and continued to do so till his death.
